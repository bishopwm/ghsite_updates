        <img class="smart-cool-img" src="img/smart-cool-pills.png" alt="Smart Cool"></div>
      <p>Smart strategy alone won't get your customers’ attention. Marketing that's cool for cool’s sake won't get results.</p>
      <p>We're a new kind of market access agency—a place where marketers responsible for creating access can meet their goals and a place where agency professionals can let their talents shine.</p>
      <p>We start with our in-house content experts who know just where customers are coming from. They help refine a brand’s value. Then, working hand in hand with our marketing experts they craft communications that speak to payers in their terms. And with our experience on both sides of the client/agency relationship, we know how to get the work done the right way.</p>
      <p class="slogan">Guarino Haskins Market Access. One agency for all your access needs.</p>

          Guarino Haskins Market Access</b></p>
        <p><b>NEW YORK, JULY 22, 2015</b> -- The Healthcare Consultancy Group (HCG), a division of the DAS Group of Companies, announces the launch of Guarino Haskins Market Access LLC, an integrated strategic consultancy and advertising agency specializing in market access.</p>
        <p>Market access, the discipline of defining and communicating the unique value provided by medications and medical devices, is becoming increasingly important in today’s rapidly changing healthcare marketplace. Guarino Haskins will address this growing need by combining the experience of leading market access professionals with the power of award-winning creative talent, to provide consulting and policy analysis, marketing and health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) communications.</p>
        <p>“Guarino Haskins will help us address some of the most critical issues our clients face today,” said Denise Bottiglieri, PhD, CEO of HCG. “Their ability to decipher and communicate payer issues will provide an important complement to our existing expertise in marketing, medical professional and regulatory communications.”</p>

        <p>“Market access is the price of entry in pharmaceutical advertising these days,” said Dale Adams, Chairman and CEO of the DAS Group of Companies. “Brands can have the best professional and consumer campaigns, but unless they have market access, they won’t achieve uptake. In Guarino Haskins Market Access we have the right people with the right approach to help our clients achieve their goals.”</p>
        <p>John Guarino, with over two decades of experience in market access on both the agency and manufacturer side, is Managing Partner, President of the company; and Roger Haskins, a veteran creative in market access communications, is Managing Partner, Executive Creative Director.</p>
        <p>Guarino has deep experience in payer strategy and marketing. Most recently serving as Managing Director, Managed Markets at inVentiv Health, he oversaw the growth of a small division into an enterprise-level agency successfully winning and servicing payer business. Prior to that, as Director of Payer Segment Marketing at Amgen, he was responsible for implementation of all marketing to corporate payer customers including commercial payers, Medicaid, Medicare, specialty retail and mail order. In 2013, Guarino was named one of the 100 most inspiring leaders in the healthcare industry for his leadership in managed markets by PharmaVOICE.</p>
        <p>“Brands live or die by their ability to secure and maintain access,” said Guarino. “At Guarino Haskins, we have a deep understanding of the complexities of the payer space and the ability to help clients define and deliver the value of their brand.” </p>
        <p>Haskins has been in consumer and healthcare agencies for more than 20 years. As a creative director, he has a successful track record of translating complex payer issues into easy-to-understand and compelling communications. While at Entrée Health as Associate Partner, Creative Director, he helped achieve significant agency growth through impactful creative and managed that growth through sound leadership.</p>
